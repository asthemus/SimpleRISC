# SimpleRISC
Multi Staged, Non Pipelined SimpleRISC based Processor<br>
Architecture Developed by Dr. Smruti Ranjan Sarangi.<br>
Architecture - SimpleRISC.<br>
Designed in Verilog.<br>
Tested and Verified on Zybo Z10 FPGA board.<br>
Requires 4 clock cycles to complete execution of one instruction. Can be improved further.<br>
As of Now, it is non pipelined.<br>
This project is complete
