# SimpleRISC
Multi Staged, Non Pipelined SimpleRISC based Processor
Architecture Developed by Dr. Smruti Ranjan Sarangi.
Architecture - SimpleRISC.
Designed in Verilog.
Tested and Verified on Zybo Z10 FPGA board.
Requires 4 clock cycles to complete execution of one instruction. Can be improved further.
As of Now, it is non pipelined.
